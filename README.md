# Windows 95 Key Generator

## What is it?
A Windows 95 and Office 95 Product Key Generator.

## Ok, cool! But why?
This project was made for the [FlyTech][flytechChannel] challenge, more exactly for [this video][video], where he explains the weakness of the Windows 95 (and Office 95) product key check system.
So, this generator was not made with the scope of being used with a real installation of Windows 95. Was made for fun, and to understand how Windows 95 works, so in short, for educational purposes only.

## So, I should not use it?
Yes, as said before, you **should not** use it on a real/virtual machine.

## Post Scriptum [P.S.]
The [generator website][webpage] has an easter-egg, I challenge you to find it out :)

Also, the code is pretty old, so don't be surprise if it is bad in general.
